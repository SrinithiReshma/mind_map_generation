 RAJARAJA CHOLA I 

  RAJARAJA CHOLA I was a renowned king of the Chola empire. 
  
    His reign was considered the golden age of Cholas.
    
      His reign spanned from 985 CE to 1014 CE.
      
        He laid the foundation for the Chola empire's maritime expansion during his son Rajendra Chola I's reign.
        
          His 30-year reign was a crucial period in Chola history.
          
            His reign saw a resurgence in various fields, including:
            
              Administration
              
              Military
              
              Fine Arts
              
              Architecture
              
              Religion
              
              Literature
            
              His administration and policies shaped the Chola empire.
            
  EARLY LIFE AND ASCENSION
  
    He was the second son of Sundara Chola, who ruled the Chola country from 957 CE to 973 CE. 
    
      He was born to Sundara Chola and Vanavan Madevi.
      
        He was born on the auspicious day of Sathayam in the month of Aippasi.
        
          His birth name was Arunmozhivarman.
          
            He was initially called Rajakesari Arunmozhivarman.
            
              He was later called Rajaraja Chola from his third year of reign (988 CE).
              
                He did not immediately ascend the throne after his father's death.
                
                  He assumed the throne 15 years after the reign of his cousin, Uttama Chola.
                  
                    He adopted the title "Sathiriya Sikamani," meaning "King of Kings."
                    
                      The Chola kingdom reached its zenith during his reign and that of his son, Rajendra Chola I.
                      
                        His reign is considered a golden age not only in Chola history but also in South Indian history.
                        
  THE PERIOD BETWEEN PARANTHAKA I AND RAJARAJA I
  
    The period between the death of Paranthaka I and the ascension of Rajaraja I was short but crucial.
    
      The sources for this period are confusing.
      
        An inscription from the second year of Rajakesari's reign reveals that the second Adithan was murdered.
        
          He was killed in a plot in a village called Melakkadambur.
          
            The inscription details the confiscation of property from those involved.
            
              The inscription is ambiguous, potentially referring to both Sundara Chola and Rajaraja Chola I.
              
                Adithan's inscriptions exist until his fifth year, indicating he ruled before his father.
                
                  The inscription's connection to Rajaraja Chola I is evident.
                  
                    The inscription reveals that the murderers of Adithan were not punished during Uttama Chola's 16-year reign.
                    
  THE MURDER OF ADITHAN AND UTTAMA CHOLA'S ASPIRATIONS
  
    Sundara Chola was greatly affected by the family tragedy.
    
      He was heartbroken by his son's death.
      
        The conspiracy surrounding Adithan's death caused him to die in despair.
        
          It's unclear if Uttama Chola was involved in the murder.
          
            Uttama Chola harbored ambition for the throne.
            
              He refused to accept any position other than the kingship.
            
                He believed that the throne belonged to him by virtue of being the elder branch of the royal family.
            
                  He gathered supporters to kill Adithan and present himself as the heir.
            
                    Sundara Chola reluctantly agreed to this plan.
                    
  ARUNMOZHIVARMAN'S REFUSAL AND UTTAMA CHOLA'S ASCENSION
  
    The Tiruvalangadu copper plates reveal that Adithan disappeared.
    
      His disappearance was attributed to his desire to ascend to heaven.
      
        The people implored Arunmozhivarman to become king to dispel the darkness.
        
          However, Arunmozhivarman refused, adhering to the principles of Kshatriya dharma.
        
            He realized his cousin's desire for the throne and allowed him to rule until his aspiration was fulfilled.
            
              Uttama Chola's ambition was fulfilled by Arunmozhivarman's self-effacement.
              
                Arunmozhivarman was not a coward, devoid of political skill, or lacking legitimate rights.
                
                  He agreed to let Uttama Chola rule to avoid civil unrest.
                  
                    He patiently agreed to succeed Uttama Chola upon the latter's demise.
                    
                      The copper plates also suggest that Arunmozhivarman possessed divine qualities, potentially influencing his reluctance to rule.
                      
  RAJARAJA CHOLA'S REIGN: ADMINISTRATIVE AND LITERARY PRACTICES
  
    Like the Pandya and Pallava rulers, Chola kings inscribed their deeds on copper plates.
    
      They first recorded their ancestors' histories.
    
        Rajaraja Chola I established the practice of incorporating praiseworthy accounts of his reign in his inscriptions.
    
          His inscriptions included detailed accounts of his reign written in eloquent Tamil.
          
            This practice became a tradition followed by subsequent Chola kings.
            
              The history sections in Chola inscriptions provide insights into each ruler's reign.
              
                They also help identify the inscriptions' creators.
                
  RAJARAJA CHOLA'S INSCRIPTIONS AND PRASEWORTHY ACCOUNTS
  
    Some rulers had multiple accounts of their deeds.
    
      Rajaraja Chola I used three kinds of praiseworthy accounts.
      
        His inscriptions starting with "TirumaghaL poLa" were widely used from his eighth year.
        
          This inscription highlights his victory at the Battle of Kantalur.
          
            It mentions his conquering of other kingdoms and his titles.
            
              The second type of praiseworthy account also emphasizes the victory at Kantalur.
              
                The third type of praiseworthy account, from his 20th year, mentions the destruction of Madurai.
                
                  It also describes his victories against other rulers and the submission of foreign kings.
                  
                    During his reign, the Tamil script transitioned from Vatteluttu to the present-day form.
                    
  MILITARY EXPANSION
  
    Rajaraja Chola I was crowned "Mummudi Chola," meaning "Chola with three crowns."
    
      His first war was against Kerala.
      
        The inscription "Kantalur Salaik Kalamarutha" from his fourth year onwards details his victory.
        
          Although this inscription appears in his fourth-year inscriptions, the lack of evidence in Kerala and Pandya country before his eighth year suggests the integration of the conquered region took time.
          
            The Tiruvalangadu copper plates confirm his initial victory in the south.
            
              They mention his capture of Amarabuyangan, the Pandya king.
              
                The inscription mentions his capture of Vizhinam, a strategically important fortress.
              
                  The inscription also notes a tripartite alliance among Pandya, Chera, and Sinhala kingdoms.
                  
                    During Rajaraja Chola I's reign, this alliance opposed him.
                    
                      The Chera king during this time was Pasukara Ravi Varma Thiruvadi.
                      
                        His inscriptions are found in various parts of Thiruvananthapuram.
                        
  THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST UTHAKAI
  
    Rajaraja Chola I captured Uthakai fortress before 1008 CE.
    
      Uthakai was located in the Western Ghats, potentially near or south of Kodagu.
    
      The Kalingathu Parani mentions the capture of Uthakai.
    
      It also mentions that Rajaraja Chola I retaliated against the Chera king who insulted his envoy.
    
      Ottakoothar mentions Rajaraja Chola I's conquest in his three UlAs.
    
      Uthakai fortress was actually Udayagiri fortress in the present-day Tenkasi district.
    
      Rajaraja Chola's commander Rajendra Chola was imprisoned by Pasukara Ravi Varma, the ruler of Venad.
    
      Rajaraja Chola I, enraged, invaded Venad, conquered it, and destroyed Udayagiri.
    
      He also destroyed the Atharva Veda schools in Chera country.
    
      He mentions this victory as "Kantalur Salaik Kalamaruthal" in his inscriptions.
    
      K.K.Pillai mentions this information in his book, "South Indian History."
    
      Kavimani Desigavinyakambillai also discusses this in his research paper on Kantalur Salai.
    
  CONQUEST OF ILAAM (CEYLON)
  
    Rajaraja Chola I's inscriptions from 993 CE confirm his conquest of Ilam.
    
      The Tiruvalangadu copper plates elaborate on the Ilam campaign.
    
      They mention that Rajaraja Chola I conquered Ilam from the Sinhalese.
    
      The inscription details his donation of Ilam villages to the Tanjore temple in his 29th year.
    
      The king of Ilam at that time was Mahinda V, who ascended the throne in 981 CE.
    
      The Mahavamsa doesn't mention this campaign.
    
      Inscriptions indicate a military coup in Mahinda V's tenth year, leading to chaos and the rise of Kannada warriors' influence.
    
      The coup forced Mahinda V to flee to Rohana.
    
      Rajaraja Chola I easily captured the northern part of Ilam and renamed it "Mummudi Chola Mandala."
    
  THE IMPACT OF THE CHOLA INVASION
  
    The Chola invasion had a lasting impact on Ilam.
    
      The Chola army destroyed Anuradhapura, Ilam's capital for over a thousand years.
    
      Polonnaruwa, a military outpost in Anuradhapura, became the new Chola capital.
    
      Previous Tamil kings like the Pandya king Thattian only conquered the north.
    
      Rajaraja Chola I's complete conquest led to a new capital, replacing the old one.
    
      The southern part of Ilam came under Tamil rule for the second time after Thattian's conquest during Rajendra Chola I's reign.
    
      Later, Vijayabahu I, the Sinhalese king, was crowned in Anuradhapura but continued to use Polonnaruwa as his capital.
    
  THE TEMPLE IN POLONNARUWA
  
    Rajaraja Chola I built a temple for Shiva in Polonnaruwa to commemorate his victory.
    
      This beautiful temple, located within Polonnaruwa's city walls, is a well-preserved ancient monument in Ilam.
    
      Its architectural style is similar to Chola-era temples built between 10th and 12th centuries, including the Great Temple in Tanjore.
    
  THE CONQUEST OF KANGAPADI, NULAMBAPADI, AND TADIKAI
  
    Rajaraja Chola I incorporated Kangapati, Nulambapadi, and Tadikai, sometimes called Tadikai Vazi, into his kingdom.
    
      Inscriptions reveal that Mysore was captured before the invasion of Vengi.
    
      This followed Rajaraja Chola I's victory at Kantalur Salai.
    
      The Cholas initially captured Tadikai and Thalaikkattu, crossing the Kaveri from Kongu country, achieving a major victory.
    
      They maintained dominance over the Ganga country for over a century.
    
  THE CONFLICT WITH THE WESTERN CHALUKYAS
  
    The Western Chalukyas did not ignore Rajaraja Chola I's campaigns.
    
      An inscription from 922 CE mentions Tailapa II's victory against a Chola king.
    
      The inscription claims Tailapa II captured 150 elephants from the Chola king.
    
      The war is believed to have taken place in 922 CE, but no concrete evidence supports this.
    
      Rajaraja Chola I's inscriptions reveal no campaigns against the Chalukyas before 994 CE.
    
      Tailapa II died a few years after 922 CE, and his son Satyashraya became the Chalukya king.
    
      Rajaraja Chola I's inscriptions mention his victory over Satyashraya and the donation of a portion of the conquered wealth to the Tanjore temple.
    
      During this time, the Paramara dynasty from Malava attacked the Chalukyas from the north.
    
      The Chalukyas struggled to fight two powerful enemies simultaneously.
    
      Rajaraja Chola I's inscriptions mention his conquest of the "Iratta Badi" region, covering 7.5 lakhs of land, around 1003 CE.
    
      This claim is exaggerated.
    
      The Tiruvalangadu copper plates mention that Satyashraya fled from Rajaraja Chola I's powerful army, making this claim believable.
    
  THE WESTERN CHALUKYA COUNTER-ATTACK
  
    An inscription from 929 CE (1007 CE) in Ottu in the Dharwad district mentions a Chola prince named Rajendra Vidhyadharan.
    
      This inscription states that he led an army of 900,000 soldiers.
    
      He plundered and devastated the country, burned cities, killed people, abducted women, and returned home with a large amount of treasure.
    
      This inscription suggests that Rajendra Chola I was involved in this campaign and won the war.
    
      The inscription further mentions Satyashraya's victory against the Cholas and the recovery of his resources and territory.
    
      While the inscription mentions atrocities committed by the Chola prince, Rajendra Chola I's conquest of Iratta Badi is confirmed.
    
  THE CHOLAS' DOMINANCE IN THE NORTHWEST
  
    The Cholas' northwestern campaign brought the Ganga and Nulambapadi regions and most of present-day Bellary district under their control.
    
      No inscriptions from Rajaraja Chola I or the Chalukya rulers have been found in Bellary.
    
      Chola inscriptions are generally scarce in remote regions of their empire.
    
      Rajaraja Chola I appointed a "Madhanda Nayaka" for the Ganga and Vengi regions.
    
      This confirms the unification of these regions and their inclusion in the Chola empire.
    
  THE CHOLAS' INTERFERENCE IN VENGI AFFAIRS
  
    Rajaraja Chola I's reign saw political developments that forced him to intervene in Vengi affairs.
    
      This intervention stemmed from his desire to separate the Eastern Chalukyas from their relatives, the Western Chalukyas.
    
      Rajaraja Chola I and his successors managed to expand their influence east of the Tungabhadra River.
    
      They failed to expand west of the river due to differences between the Eastern and Western Chalukyas.
    
  THE DECLINE OF THE EASTERN CHALUKYAS AND THE RISE OF THE WESTERN CHALUKYAS
  
    During the Eastern Chalukyas' rule in Vengi, they fought a prolonged war against the Rashtrakutas.
    
      This three-year war weakened the Eastern Chalukyas.
    
      They suffered from exhaustion, internal turmoil, and the Cholas' arrival.
    
      However, the Eastern Chalukyas rallied under the Cholas' leadership.
    
      For the next century, they became loyal supporters of the Cholas.
    
      They repaid their debt by assisting the Cholas during the reign of Kulothunga Chola I and his descendants, known as Chola Chalukyas, furthering the Chola empire's growth.
    
      The Western Chalukyas, on the other hand, were freed from the Rashtrakutas under Tailapa II's leadership.
    
      They emerged as a powerful and independent kingdom.
    
      They attempted to unite with the Eastern Chalukyas against the Cholas.
    
      However, they were attacked from both sides, by the Paramara dynasty in the north and the Cholas in the south.
    
      This forced them to focus on protecting the Iratta Badi region and prevented them from expanding their territory.
    
      They lost their zeal for expansion and lacked the time.
    
      While the initial rulers of a dynasty are typically strong, their lineage often maintains its success for several generations.
    
  THE CHOLA EXPANSION IN THE NORTH
  
    During Paranthaka I's reign, the Chola empire extended northwards to Nellore.
    
      However, they lost territory during the Rashtrakutas' invasion.
    
      Rajaraja Chola I's predecessors recaptured only a few areas.
    
      To reclaim the northern territories, including Thiruvottriyur near Chennai, he launched a northward campaign.
    
  THE EASTERN CHALUKYAS' INTERNAL STRUGGLES
  
    The Eastern Chalukyas' troubles began during the reign of Amma II (945-970 CE).
    
      These troubles were fueled by the Rashtrakutas' ambitious king, Krittivirma III, and internal feuds among the Eastern Chalukyas.
    
      Amma II usurped the throne from his cousin in 945 CE.
    
      The younger branch, including Padaban and Thazhan II, waited for an opportunity to claim the throne.
    
      Krittivirma III, who had defeated Paranthaka Chola I, focused his attention on Vengi.
    
      The internal conflicts among the Eastern Chalukyas were advantageous to him.
    
      Amma II married the sister of Vima, the powerful king of Pedakallu.
    
      Vima played a significant role in supporting his brother-in-law.
    
  THE REIGN OF AMMA II
  
    Amma II's reign lasted for 25 years, from 945 to 970 CE.
    
      His rule was unstable.
    
      He defeated Yuthamallan II upon ascending the throne.
    
      However, Yuthamallan II's sons, Padaban and Thazhan II, retaliated.
    
      Amma II was forced to flee Vengi and lost his throne.
    
      He was helped by some Vengi residents and Krittivirma III.
    
  THE RETURN OF AMMA II
  
    The copper plates of Padaban and Thazhan II mention the assistance provided by Krittivirma III.
    
      However, Amma II fled to Kalinga and returned with the help of Nirupkama, the ruler of Kolanu.
    
      He defeated Thazhan II's rule before 955 CE.
    
      Amma II married the daughter of the Kolanu ruler and killed Thazhan II in battle.
    
      The Saktivarman Patta inscription mentions that Amma II sent a king to heaven, referring to Thazhan II.
    
  THE RENEWED ATTACK BY KRITTIVIRMA III
  
    Krittivirma III launched another attack on Vengi, forcing Amma II to flee to Kalinga once again.
    
      This event occurred after Amma II's eleventh year, as mentioned in the Mangallu inscriptions.
    
      Krittivirma III granted rulership to Dhanarnavana, who had the support of a faction opposed to Amma II in Vengi.
    
      After the Rashtrakutas withdrew, Amma II returned to his kingdom.
    
      He made peace with Dhanarnavana and ruled for a short time.
    
      Dhanarnavana eventually rebelled against Amma II, killed him in battle, and took the throne.
    
  VIMA'S ASCENSION
  
    Vima, who was under Krittivirma III's control, had possibly assisted the Rashtrakuta king in conquering Vengi.
    
      However, after Krittivirma III's death, he gained independence.
    
      He defeated Dhanarnavana, captured the region of Pottadi, and killed Dhanarnavana.
    
      He drove out Dhanarnavana's children and conquered all of Vengi.
    
      The Eastern Chalukyas consider the 25-year period between Dhanarnavana's death and the beginning of Saktivarman I's reign (973-999 CE) as a period of chaos and ill fate.
    
  RAJARAJA CHOLA I'S INTERVENTION IN VENGI
  
    When Rajaraja Chola I ascended the throne, the Western Chalukyas, under Tailapa II and Satyashraya, had risen in power.
    
      Dhanarnavana's children sought refuge in Chola country.
    
      This influenced Rajaraja Chola I's policy towards the Western Chalukyas.
    
      He used them as a tool to interfere in Vengi affairs.
    
      During this period, Vima and the Western Chalukyas entered into an agreement.
    
  RAJARAJA CHOLA I'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST VENGI
  
    Rajaraja Chola I invaded Vengi, aiming to install Saktivarman on the throne, around 999 CE.
    
      He killed Ekaviran, a powerful warrior sent by Vima to oppose him.
    
      He also killed Padtheman and Maharajan, two powerful leaders.
    
      Saktivarman's inscriptions mention that Rajaraja Chola I uprooted the tree of Sedasoda, representing Vima's defeat.
    
      However, the war was intense and lasted for several years.
    
  THE ASCENSION OF VIMALADITHAN
    
      Inscriptions suggest that Vimaladithan ascended the throne of Vengi on the 10th of May 1011 CE.
    
      His brother, Saktivarman, had ruled for twelve years before him.
    
      This indicates that Saktivarman ascended the throne in 999 CE, ending the "interregnum" period.
    
  THE CHOLAS AND THE WESTERN CHALUKYAS' CONFLICT
    
      Satyashraya could not tolerate Vima's downfall and the inclusion of Vengi under Rajaraja Chola I's control.
    
      This marked the beginning of a recurring conflict between the Cholas and the Western Chalukyas over Vengi for the next 135 years.
    
  THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST MALDIVES
    
      The final war of Rajaraja Chola I was against the Maldivian islands, known as "Munneer Pazhanthivu Panniraayiram."
    
      Detailed accounts of this maritime campaign are unavailable.
    
      However, it's evident that Rajaraja Chola I established a strong navy, which Rajendra Chola I effectively used later.
    
  RAJARAJA CHOLA'S ARCHITECTURE: THE RAJARAJESWARAM TEMPLE
  
    The Rajarajeswaram Shiva temple, built by Rajaraja Chola I in Tanjore, is a magnificent landmark in South Indian history.
    
      This architectural marvel is a testament to the Chola empire's architectural excellence and a lasting symbol of Rajaraja Chola I's reign.
